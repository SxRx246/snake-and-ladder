# Snakes and Ladders Game

## Introduction
Snakes and Ladders is a classic board game where players navigate a grid by rolling dice. The objective is to reach the final square (100) while avoiding snakes that send you backward and using ladders that help you advance. This project was developed as part of a Front End Development course at General Assembly.

## Project Brief
The objective of Snakes and Ladders is to guide a player and a computer through a grid filled with snakes and ladders. The game features:
- A grid-based design suitable for desktop browsers.
- Mechanisms for players to win or lose, with appropriate feedback.
- Implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A playable game for one player against a computer opponent.

## Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git

## Game Design
The game board is constructed using a grid of divs, allowing for accurate placement of player sprites, snakes, and ladders. The grid is managed using a 2D array, which simplifies position tracking for both players.

## Game Mechanics

### Player Movement
Players roll a dice to determine how many spaces to move. The movement is managed through mouse clicks, updating the player's position on the grid.

### Computer Movement
The computer takes its turn after the player, rolling its own dice and moving accordingly. The game logic ensures fair play and checks for winning conditions after each turn.

### Snakes and Ladders
- **Snakes:** If the player lands on a snake, they slide down to a lower position, which is handled through collision detection.
- **Ladders:** Landing on a ladder allows the player to climb up to a higher position.

### Collision Detection
Collision detection checks if a player's position corresponds with a snake or ladder. If a player lands on a snake, they are moved down; landing on a ladder moves them up.

### Winning and Losing
The game ends when a player reaches the 100th cell. Appropriate messages are displayed to indicate whether the player has won or lost as well as an audio will be played

## Audio Feedback
The game includes various audio effects to enhance user experience:
- Sounds for rolling the dice.
- Audio feedback for winning and losing.
- Sound effects for landing on snakes and ladders.

## Further Learning
- Exploring more advanced collision detection algorithms.
- Implementing additional features like a two-player mode or more complex animations.

## In Conclusion
Developing the Snakes and Ladders game was a rewarding experience that combined creativity with technical challenges. The game provides a solid foundation for further development and offers engaging gameplay. Future improvements could include additional features and enhancements for a more immersive experience.
